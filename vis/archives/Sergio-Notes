When comparing the inside airbnb dataframe to others using zip codes, the merging or concatting of the dataframes needs to be ammended in a way so that when the merge encounters a zipcode in the zillow df for instance that doesn't exist in the airbnb df, it captures/records that zipcode and enters a 0 for the count of airbnbs for that zipcode. The way it's currently scripted on the merge will only grab zipcodes that match in both dataframes. Bronx for instance only has 5 zip codes I believe at the moment. So I cocked it up somewhere, and need to go back and find out where.

Also the current merging with the acs data, essentially eliminates all the years prior to 2015 since that's the earlierst data we currently have from airbnb
